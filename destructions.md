#### Pros of using bootstrap: 

- Saves time by giving you a platform with all basic and components needed. 
- UI that looks good out of the box.
- Lots of free templates and themes. 
- Fully customizable, you can as little or as much as you want. 

#### Cons of using bootstrap: 

- Lots of overriding needed if you don't create your own classes (Thousands of lines of code)
- Websites start to look the same if you don't customize them. 
- Websites are often static until a back-end is built.
